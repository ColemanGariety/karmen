This file documents the most important changes for each release of
Karmen.  For a complete list of changes, refer to the SVN repository.

Changes in version 0.15 (2008-12-28)
====================================

	* Buttons look nicer when pressed.

	* Reliable signal handling using the "self-pipe" trick.

	* Improved menu positioning.

Changes in version 0.14 (2008-05-25)
====================================

	* Fix bug that left stale resize information window if the
	  resized window was destroyed.

	* Do not define a mouse cursor for the root window.
	  People may want to do this themselves (think left-handed).


Changes in version 0.13 (2007-09-04)
====================================

	* "Smart" window placement:  The algorithm tries hard not
	  to let new windows cover existing ones.  Hopefully this
	  is less annoying than random placement.  

	* The menu will now stay open on mouse click, like most
	  modern menus do.  It also looks nicer.

	* Define mouse cursor for the root window.


Changes in version 0.12 (2007-08-19)
====================================

	* New menu look.

	* Optimize repainting of widgets.

	* Add options -display, -font, -help and -version.

	* Fix a long-standing bug causing some windows not to
	  be managed correctly when Karmen starts.

	* Allow windows to be as small as 1x1 pixel.

	* Improved text positioning in window titles and menus.


Changes in version 0.11 (2007-04-03)
====================================

	* Remove the "Lower" window button.

	* Move the "Delete" window button to the right hand side.


Changes in version 0.10 (2007-02-07)
====================================

	* When hiding a window, move its menu item to the bottom
	  of the Windows menu.

	* Pressing the Shift key while clicking a window's title
	  bar toggles the stay-on-top property.  The key binding
	  is Meta-Space.

	* Moving related windows is now done by holding down the
	  Control key instead of the Shift key.

	* Honor window gravity in ConfigureRequest events.  This is
	  required by ICCCM/EWMH.  Unfortunately, this change breaks
	  full screen mode for some applications (notably Firefox),
	  since Karmen doesn't (yet) support undecorated windows.
	  However, it solves some other strangeness.

	* If a window does not provide an icon name, display the
	  window name in the Windows menu.

	* Fix bug that caused Karmen to exit on the SIGCONT signal.
	  This was triggered by the following case:

	    $ karmen
	    ^Z
	    Stopped (SIGSTOP)
	    $ bg
	    [ karmen exits ]

	* Define mouse pointers for all widgets.


Changes in version 0.9 (2006-12-14)
====================================

	* Finally fix a serious and long-lasting bug that caused
	  configure requests to not being handled correctly.  This
	  problem was visible in XMMS and recent versions of MPlayer.

	* Fix bug in window stack code that sometimes caused an
	  assertion when unmanaging windows.

	* Fixed a bug in the handling of transient windows.

	* Transient windows no longer have lower and unmap buttons.

	* The window group is only raised if the newly selected window was
	  not already in the active window group.

	* Properly remove the size window if the menu is brought up
	  during a resize operation.

	* Find a new active window if a window is lowered that is either
	  a transient for the active window, or the window for which the
	  active window is a transient.


Changes in version 0.8a (2006-11-16)
====================================

	* Fancy window borders.

	* Move window group and transient windows if Shift is held
	  down while moving a window.

	* When a window is activated, make sure it's not completely
	  off screen.

	* Use random placement for new windows instead of centering them.
	  Please raise your voice if you can't live with this.

	* Basic support for colormaps.

	* Fix memory leak when restacking windows.

	* Unmap transients when a window is unmapped.

	* Lower transients when a window is lowered.

	* Fix memory leak when unmanaging windows.

	* Fix bug that caused some ignored X errors to be reported.


Changes in version 0.7a (2006-10-04)
====================================

	* Implement a modular interface of "hooks" that makes
	  it possible to support standards beyond ICCCM.

	* Implement basic support for Extended Window Manager Hints
	  using the new hooks interface.  The support is optional,
	  use --disable-ewmh to turn it off.

	* Highlight transient and group member windows of the
	  active window.

	* Improve window restacking operations by keeping an
	  internal record of the stacking order.

	* Improved ICCCM compliance.

	* Bug fixes.


Changes in version 0.6a (2006-09-24)
====================================

	* Switch to the MIT license.

	* Meta-Shift-Tab cycles backward in the Windows menu.

	* Fix bug that caused Karmen to ignore when windows
	  request to be hidden/shown.  Reported and fixed by
	  Alejandro Liu.

	* Improved signal/event handling.

	* Fix problems with keyboard shortcuts and mouse buttons
	  not working while Caps Lock, Num Lock and/or Scroll
	  Lock are active.  Reported by Alejandro Liu.


Changes in version 0.5a (2006-09-11)
====================================

	* Rewrite the menu to include all (not only hidden) windows.

	* Implement Windows-style window cycling.  See the manual
	  page for more info.

	* Change some key bindings.  See the manual page for
	  details.

	* Don't kill windows that won't close properly when the
	  delete button (X) is pressed.  Eventually, a shift-click
	  operation will be implemented for killing the program.


Changes in version 0.4a (2006-07-23)
====================================

	* Fix a bug that caused Karmen to sometimes mix up managed
	  and unmanaged windows.
