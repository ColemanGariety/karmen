INTRODUCTION

   Karmen is an easy-to-use window manager for X. It is designed to
"just work". There is no configuration file and no library
dependencies except Xlib. Window selection is done in click-to-focus
style.

   Karmen comes with a UNIX-style manual page. After installation,
you should be able to view it by typing "man karmen" from your shell.

   The latest version of Karmen can be downloaded from the homepage.
The URL is provided at the top of this file.

   Karmen is released under the MIT license, which is an open source
license approved by the Open Source Initiative [http://opensource.org].
See the file LICENSE for details.

   The NEWS file documents the history of significant changes in each
version of Karmen.


GOALS

   The following goals are set for the future Karmen 1.0 release:

   * Intuitive, efficient window management

   * Provide high-quality look and feel

   * Standards compliance (ICCCM and EWMH/NetWM)

   * Work well as a stand-alone window manager

   * Work well with other desktop utilities and environments

   * Focus on window management and let other tools do the rest


NORMAL BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

   Karmen uses the GNU Autotools build framework. Read the INSTALL
file in the root directory of the distribution for details and
options. In most cases it's just a matter of typing:

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ make install

   This will build and install the program and manual page under the
/usr/local directory.


MAILING LIST

   There is a mailing list for Karmen. To post a message to all the
list members, send email to <karmen-users@lists.sourceforge.net>.

the karmen-users mailing list, or submit a bug report or feature
request at the Sourceforge project homepage:

SUBVERSION REPOSITORY ACCESS

   To check out the current development version of Karmen, make sure
you have the Subversion client installed and type the command:

	$ svn co https://svn.sourceforge.net:/svnroot/karmen/trunk karmen
    
This will put the latest development version of Karmen in the
directory named "karmen". In order to build Karmen from these
sources, you must first bootstrap the Autotools. This means you
must have GNU Autoconf and Automake installed on your system. In
the root directory of the distribution, type the command:

	$ autoreconf -i

   Now the build tools are setup, and you can configure and build
Karmen as described in the normal build instructions.
